# Implementing a Full Adder and Computing an Unknown Phase Change on a Quantum Computer 

## Introduction

This project consists of two parts: implementing a full adder and computing an unknown phase change on a quantum computer. For the full adder, three qubits are added together in a sum and carry structure to obtain the result of 3. For the phase change, a preset phase change of pi/2 was used and then recovered through computation and running the two circuits on a quantum computer.

## Setup

1. You have to make an account on IBM qiskit
2. You should use Quantum Composer to do upload the Jupyter notebook from this repository
3. Each cell should be run sequentially in order to obtain the result

## Results

For the full adder, I was able to count to three with the case of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 

For the quantum phase computer, I was able to recover the phase change of pi/2 with a good degree of accuracy. 

## Discussion

I made note of the fact that I would like to implement more and more interesting cases as well for the full adder. Additionally, the result was not incredibly decisive. The desired result was the most probable, but not by much.

The phase calculator worked essentially as expected. 


## Outlook

I would like to implement more cases for both the full adder and the quantum phase calculator. I would like to ensure that the full adder works for all of the possible input cases, and I would like to ensure that the phase calculator works for phases apart from pi/2.

Additionally, more qubits could be implemented to the full adder in order to count to higher numbers, or to commence mathematical operations apart from addition.
