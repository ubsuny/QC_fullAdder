    "\n",
    "* learning __computatuional physics__\n",
    "- learning things about __quantum computer__\n",
    "+ practicing programming in **C++** and **Python**\n",
    "- learning how to write proper **numerical algorithms**\n",

    "### Reference -- how do other people do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [they learn it from slack channel: https://app.slack.com](https://app.slack.com)\n",
    "2. [They learn it from UB learns: https://ublearns.buffalo.edu](https://ublearns.buffalo.edu)\n",

    "### Methods -- how did I implement it?\n",
    "\n",
    "> I would implement my purposes by attending class on time and finishing every assignment at my best.\n",
    "> I should also listen to other people's suggestions and explore area I'm interested to learn this course.\n",
